# planx-content-migrations

These scripts are for bulk updates of Planx flow content related to new code features. Many of them are likely one-off scenarios, some we may want to extract to re-usable jobs in the future.

## Running this script

Install Node & PNPM globally if you don't have them already.

Clone this repo & run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.

Run `pnpm start:{feature folder name}` to start the onboarding prompts.
